    <h3>Marty The Martian</h3>
    <p>Marty is a Martian from a planet called Mars, a place way different from our land of cars. He does rather like our planet however, even so much as an old duck's feather. He sees our strange ways and things that we do, and wonders why he can't be a part of it too. "The Earth looks fun! I must go and see! Oh I hope when they see me they won't turn and flee". But much like he feared, the people all ran. Even throwing things at him! Things like a pan! They screamed and shouted, "He must be the devil!" Marty was so sad they weren't all on the same level."Why can't we be equal? Please do not fear me. I came to Earth especially to see thee." But the officials of Earth said, "Go home, weird stranger, or else you will be in some real danger!" Sad and confused, Marty went home. "I don't like it here... living in a doam." But sure enough, God heard his sad plee, and said to the Martian, "Of you, I'll make three." Now Marty is never alone on a planet called Mars. "Who needs Earth! I've got us and the stars."</p>
